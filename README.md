# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Libraries

#### Chakra UI

Chakra UI comes pre-configured with this lab, so you don't have to worry about installing it or setting it up.

The components from this library you will need to use are already imported from the @chakra-ui/react package at the top of each corresponding file. If you don't see a component already imported, it's because you probably won't need it. In any case, feel free to check their official [documentation](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components "https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components") to see all the components at your disposal and their corresponding props.

#### Formik and Yup

The Formik library is already set up in the project as well, so no extra configuration is needed. In this lab, you will be only using the useFormik hook from the Formik library, as well as the global Yup object to define the Contact Me form validation rules.

The form UI will be implemented using Chakra UI components.
